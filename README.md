Learning and doing
My name is Vilmarie, prefer Vil.  I'm new to the world of coding with some very limited experience with HTML in my early teens and some practice with Javascript through Grasshopper.  I'm interested, eager, nervous, excited, and all the other feelings that come with picking a new skill up.
